Ignoring her calls, refusing to answer the door at the clinic, or speak to her after she'd tracked him down at Enfield crematorium as he scattered his Aunt's ashes. Despite it all, it’s often said that friends give the best therapy so Vogue & Joanne have teamed up to do exactly that (alongside a generous helping of laughter as that too is said to be the best form of therapy). Together they will give 100% unqualified, unsubstantiated but up front and honest advice on the plethora of issues they and many others continue to grapple with.\n\nIf you'd like to get in touch, you can send an email to hello@MTGMpod.com\n\nFor live shows, merch and more, visit mytherapistghostedme.com\n\nPlease review Global's Privacy Policy: https://global.com/legal/privacy-policy/\n\nFor advertising opportunities on this podcast email: dax@global.com"

Expect probing questions, awkward small talk and unusual personality challenges designed to reveal what’s really going on beneath the surface.\n\nIt's part interview, part experiment and could only come from the mind of Joe Marler.\n\nJoe Marler Will See You Now - your appointment awaits."
