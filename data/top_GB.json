Raynor Winn has since published two more books and The Salt Path has been adapted for the big screen, starring Jason Isaacs and Gillian Anderson.\nAt its heart it is a simple tale, of a couple embarking on a 630 mile trek in the face of stark adversity. When faced with nothing, they chose to walk.\nBut when reporter Chloe Hadjimatheou received a tip-off that the memoir may not be the \"unflinchingly honest\" account it claimed to be, suddenly things began to unravel. And the questions, about what is and isn't true, began mounting.\nHow far can you bend the truth before it begins to break?\nEpisode 1 will be available to listen on Tuesday 13th January.\nSubscribe to Observer+ on Apple Podcasts and Spotify to binge listen to all 7 episodes on Tuesday 13th January.\nSubscribe to The Observer today and get access to:\nOur podcasts before anyone elseA daily edition, curated by our editors 7 days a weekPuzzles from the inventors of the cryptic crosswordRecipes for every occasionFree tickets to join Observer events in our newsroom or online\nClick here to subscribe today for just £1 for your first month.\nReporter - Chloe Hadjimatheou\nProducer - Matt Russell\nMusic supervision and sound design - Karla Patella\nSound design - Rowan Bishop\nPodcast artwork - Lola Williams \nExecutive producer - Jasper Corbett\n\n Hosted on Acast.

As well as being a podcast, we are also available every Friday on the World Service. Oh, and by the way, you can now listen to Americast on a smart speaker. If you want to listen, just say ‘”Ask BBC Sounds to play Americast”. It works on most smart speakers.\n \nEvery Monday we answer your questions on Americanswers, with some help from special guests, including Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department for Homeland Security during the Trump presidency before becoming a whistleblower.
